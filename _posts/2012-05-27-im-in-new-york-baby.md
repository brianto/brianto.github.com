Yes! I'm finally here. In a few short days, I'll be working for Google NYC!

My dad took me visit the Google office on Ninth Avenue. Somehow, the directions
for getting out of the station at the correct place is more complicated than the
directions for traversing the subway network. A few of the exits have multiple
entrances to the street. The station at the port authority has a bunch. There's
one exit labeled 15th street, but it's actually _between_ 14th and 15th street.
I need to exit out of the last exist. That station is a confusing mess. I'll get
another chance again to burn the route into my mind.

That reminds me, how _does_ the subway system work?

Chinese food in NYC is surprisingly good, especially for the same price I find
back in Rochester. A large bowl of wanton soup is under $5. Small meat pastries
(among other simple pastries) are about 70&cent; each. Quite a bargain.  There
are cool flavors like curry beef, chicken, and roast pork for the savory and
things like lemon and taro for the sweet. Small cake pastries are just over a
dollar! I have a feeling I might buy these things in bulk and enjoy them over
the week.

May the foods be with you.
